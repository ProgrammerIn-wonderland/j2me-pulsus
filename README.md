# J2ME Pulsus!!

This is my port-ish of the game https://pulsus.cc to j2me dumbish phones. A builder which injects maps in is available at https://github.com/ProgrammerIn-wonderland/j2me-rhythm-proxy or publicly at https://j2me-pulsus.rafflesia.dev/

### Requirements
* This game requires a phone or emulator with MP3 support. Many emulators (such as microemulator or most JVM based emulators) do not support MP3 do to licensing reasons in JMF. J2ME-Loader on android does and most physical handhelds do.
* MIDP 2.0
* CLDC 1.1 -- With floating point support (used in some animations
* Multiple voices (for hitsounds otherwise they wont play)
